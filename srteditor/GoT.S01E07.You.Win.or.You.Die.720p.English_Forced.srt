According to the prophecy. . .`

3
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,817
. . .the stallion will ride
to the ends of the earth.

4
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:57,528
The earth ends at the black salt sea.

5
00:26:57,655 --> 00:26:59,572
No horse can cross the poison water.

6
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:01,783
The earth does not end at the sea. . .

7
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:04,244
. . .there are many dirts beyond the sea.

8
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,663
The dirt where I was born.

9
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,293
Not dirts. Lands.

10
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,712
Lands, yes. . .

11
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:18,633
There are thousands of ships
in the free cities.

12
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,677
Wooden horses that fly across the sea. . .

13
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:24,514
Let's speak no more of wooden horses
and iron chairs.

14
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,307
It's not a chair. It's a. . .

15
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:39,654
A chair for a King to sit upon,

16
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,364
or. . .

17
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,157
. . .a Queen.

18
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,043
A King does not need a chair to sit upon.

19
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:56,963
He only needs a horse.

20
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:48,074
Sweet reds. . .

21
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,831
I have sweet reds from Lys,
Volantis and the Arbor!

22
00:29:54,957 --> 00:29:57,667
Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours!

23
00:29:57,793 --> 00:30:00,128
I have them! I have them!

24
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,755
A taste for the Khaleesi?

25
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:05,758
I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.

26
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:09,637
One taste and you'II
name your first child after me.

27
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:04,150
Put down that cask.

28
00:49:28,462 --> 00:49:30,338
Moon of my life.

29
00:49:30,923 --> 00:49:32,424
Are you hurt?

30
00:49:43,311 --> 00:49:44,853
Jorah the Andal,

31
00:49:44,979 --> 00:49:47,731
I heard what you did.

32
00:49:47,857 --> 00:49:51,401
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.

33
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:59,576
I make this gift to you.

34
00:50:04,957 --> 00:50:09,794
And to my son,
the stallion who will mount the world,

35
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,381
I will also pledge a gift.

36
00:50:13,507 --> 00:50:17,677
I will give him the iron chair. . .

37
00:50:17,803 --> 00:50:21,806
. . .that his mother's father sat upon.

38
00:50:22,642 --> 00:50:25,644
I will give him Seven Kingdoms.

39
00:50:27,229 --> 00:50:31,775
I, Drogo, will do this.

40
00:50:32,276 --> 00:50:35,654
I will take my Khalasar west
to where the worId ends. . .

41
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:41,242
. . .and ride wooden horses
across the black salt water. . .

42
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:44,871
- . . .as no Khal has done before.
- (Men cheering)

43
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:51,586
I will kill the men in iron suits. . .

44
00:50:51,712 --> 00:50:54,714
- (Cheering)
- (Still Cheering)

45
00:50:57,134 --> 00:51:00,887
- I will rape their women. . .
- (Cheering)
- (Cheering even more!!)

46
00:51:01,013 --> 00:51:03,515
. . .take their children as slaves. . .

47
00:51:03,641 --> 00:51:06,768
. . .and bring their broken gods
back to Vaes Dothrak.

48
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:12,732
This, I vow. . .

49
00:51:12,858 --> 00:51:15,777
. . . I, Drogo, son of Bharbo.

50
00:51:17,363 --> 00:51:22,158
I swear before the Mother of Mountains. . .

51
00:51:22,284 --> 00:51:24,119
. . .as the stars look down in witness.

52
00:51:25,871 --> 00:51:28,748
As the stars look down in witness.
